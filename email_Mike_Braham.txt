Subject: Extending Intempo Health’s signage durability & reducing maintenance costs

Hi Mike Braham,

I came across Intempo Health’s work in recent trade shows and associations and wanted to
connect, given your leadership in Intempo Health.

Across the signage and graphics space, teams are turning to DuPont Tedlar films to cut down 
on maintenance, avoid costly replacements, and ensure consistent brand presence despite 
UV exposure and harsh weather conditions. These solutions are helping industry leaders in 
maximizing ROI while protecting visual assets long-term.

Would you be open to a short call to explore how this could benefit your upcoming projects?

Best,  
Prajwal Agrawal
