Subject: Extending Squadron Aviation Services Ltd.’s signage durability & reducing maintenance costs

Hi Philippe Winter,

I came across Squadron Aviation Services Ltd.’s work in recent trade shows and associations and wanted to
connect, given your leadership in Squadron Aviation Services Ltd..

Across the signage and graphics space, teams are turning to DuPont Tedlar films to cut down 
on maintenance, avoid costly replacements, and ensure consistent brand presence despite 
UV exposure and harsh weather conditions. These solutions are helping industry leaders in 
maximizing ROI while protecting visual assets long-term.

Would you be open to a short call to explore how this could benefit your upcoming projects?

Best,  
Prajwal Agrawal
